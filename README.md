# 👋 Hello, I'm Martin Justa

I'm a curious and driven programmer who enjoys solving problems, learning new technologies, and writing clean, reusable, and well-structured code. I care about clarity — in both code and project organization — and always aim to keep my files, folders, and logic tidy and easy to follow.

I take pride in breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces — and either solving them directly or cutting deeper until I find a clean solution.

Currently, I'm a student at 42 Prague, where I've completed the 42 Piscine and have since worked on various low-level and systems programming projects in C — including custom implementations of standard library functions, Unix process handling, and basic 2D graphics using a minimalist graphical library. These projects have helped me build a strong foundation in computer science and practical software engineering.

I’m not focused on a single specialization — I’m confident in my ability to adapt and tackle any technical challenge that comes my way.
