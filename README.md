# 👋 Hello, I'm [Your Name]

I'm a passionate programmer with a growing interest in software development, systems programming, and clean, efficient code.  
Currently a student at **42 Prague**, where I'm exploring low-level programming in **C** and deepening my understanding of computer science fundamentals.  
Previously, I've worked on several **TypeScript** projects, including full-stack applications using modern JavaScript frameworks.
